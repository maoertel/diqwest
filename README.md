# diqwest

This crate extends `reqwest` to be able to send requests with digest auth flow.

It is currently implemented for `async` usage only.

## Example
```rust
use diqwest::core::WithDigestAuth;
use reqwest::{Client, Response};

// Call `.send_with_basic_auth()` at the end of your request builder chain like you would use `send()`
let response: Response = Client::new()
  .get("url")
  .send_with_digest_auth("username", "password")
  .await?;
```
